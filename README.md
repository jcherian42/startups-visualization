# Startups Visualization

This project was developed as part of CSCE 667: Curation and Ideation. The idea was to demonstrate the advantages of monadic exploration over more traditional methods of network exploration. The ability to make sense of a wide amount of information from a variety of sources is particularly important to crowdfunding investors, as information on startups can be scattered yet vital to determining their viability.

Inspiration for monadic visualization was taken from: http://mariandoerk.de/monadicexploration/demo
